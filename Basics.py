# console is where we have a little window into what our program is doing

# Pyton is looking at these instructions line by line in order

# The order in which we write the instructions is very important. It matters a lot

# Variables and Data Types

# In python we'll be dealing with a lot of data, values and information

# That data can be difficult to manage

# A variable is a container where we can store certain data values, and when we use variables it's a lot easier to work with and manage the information in our programs.

# Let's start with this story

print("There once was a man named George, ")
print("he was 70 years old. ")
print("He really liked the name George, ")
print("but didn't like being 70.")

print()

# Let's say we wanted to change the name in the story from George to John, or change the age, we'd have to do it line by line. Except we have Variables which make it easier for us:

#variable_name

character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"

#Now we can just add in the variables in the story

print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old. ")
print("He really liked the name George, ")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")

# Now all you would have to do is change the variables to update many lines in the story.

# We can update the variable simply writing it out again

character_name = "Tom"

print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old. ")
print("He really liked the name George, ")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")

# We are storing these names as strings

# Strings are plain text

# Can store numbers, don't use quotations

character_age = 35 # can store whole numbers
character age = 35.5 # can store decimal numbers

# Boolean returns true or false values. Example:

is_male = False
